## Payment gateways

*"Good, cheap or both"*

Alternatives:

* [Adyen](https://www.adyen.com): [finnish e-banking](https://www.adyen.com/payment-methods/finnish-e-banking), bank transfer is €0,65 per payment
* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-fi):
* [Paytrail](https://www.paytrail.com/en/): really good but it is on the pricey side. 59€/month + (0.40€  + 2-3%) per transaction.
* Checkout (Paytrail)
* [Bambora](https://www.bambora.com/fi/fi/online/): Uses [Visma Pay](https://www.visma.fi/vismapay/) Which has 0 monthly fee + 0.40-0.60€+2.8% per transaction
* [Klarna](https://www.klarna.com/): 6% per transaction + 0.2€ So it gets expensive
* [Nets](https://www.nets.eu/fi-fi)
* Svea (formerly Maksuturva): fixed fees for [bank payments](https://www.svea.com/fi/fi/yritykset/maksuratkaisut/maksutavat/verkkopankkimaksut/) 0,35€ or 0,5€ for Nordea. 59€ per month platform fee.

Suggested choices:

* Adyen if you want cheap than Stripe but Stripe has better developer experience.

Notes of Paytrail:

* The other vendors do not cater that much for the global world. Only paytrail really have documentation and website in English the rest of them are all in Finnish.
* 2.8% is huge commission compared to EU credit/debit cards or SEPA payments with Stripe or Adyen
